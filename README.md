# unphoto

Download the pic of the day from differing sources. This is inspired by another
application I had that would download and set a new wallpaper each day.
Currently it's only working with The Guardian daily photo's.

## Usage

At the moment, it will download the daily photo into the current working
directory.

```
./unphoto --guardian
```
